# Missing covariates regression in markov chain
This project focus on the analysis of missing covariates regression in markov chian.
First, we will simulate mulitple continuous stationary markov chains where the transition intensity depends on linear model with some covariates.

Second, randomly selected a part of covariates as observed covariates. 

Third, learning the linear relations based on the observed covariates using different methods. 

Methodologies:

Frequentist approach
a. complete estimation.
b. using the missing indicator.
c. random imputation
d. multiple random imputation

Bayesian approach
e. bayesian model

Fourth, model the relation between covariates.
Gaussian process?
Time series model ARMA?
